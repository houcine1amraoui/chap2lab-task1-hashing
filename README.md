# Lab2 - Task1: Hashing Demo
In this task, you will get a demonstration of how hashing can help in securely storing data. In particular, we see the use case of storing users’ password to perform authentication.

## Project Preparation
1.	Clone or download the code from the following GitHub repo: https://github.com/houcine1amraoui/lab2-task1-hashing-demo  
2.	Open the project folder with VS Code.
3.	Open the integrated terminal, “cd” into the “server” folder, then run “npm install” command to install the dependencies used by the server.
4.	Open the integrated terminal, “cd” into the “client” folder, then run “npm install” command to install the dependencies used by the client.
5.	Run the server.

## Questions
1.	In the client script, set the password to “test123“, run the client and explain what has been displayed and why.
2.	Now, try to find the correct password by inspecting the server-side code, then set the password to such a value, then run the client script.
3.	Which threat does hashing protect from in the case of storing hashed passwords instead of clear-text?
